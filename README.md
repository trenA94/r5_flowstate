Strafing Dummy mod for r5 flowstate aim trainer.

Made the bot able to long strafe(while still facing you), stutter step, and have ads slow down occasionally. Bot also should strafe with a bias. Attempted to make bot slow down on hit but not sure if it actually works. Removed random crouching on spot.

Also made aqueduct_night selectable for this mode, though selecting character on this map will cause it to crash(to be fixed). Just type sv_cheats 1 into console and select character through dev menu instead.

Unzip and place platform file into r5 folder.
